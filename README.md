PrimeFactorsKata
================
The problem:

Write a class named “PrimeFactors” that has one static method: generate.
The generate method takes an integer argument and returns a List<Integer>.
That list contains the prime factors in numerical sequence.

The solution includes a UT project and a small ConsoleApplication that tests my class.
